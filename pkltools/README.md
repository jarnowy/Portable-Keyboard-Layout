A set of tools to convert Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator to Mate Farkas's Portable Keyboard Layout.

Forked from [Portable Keyboard layout's utilities](https://github.com/Portable-Keyboard-Layout/Portable-Keyboard-Layout/tree/master/utilities).

No installation script is provided: deploy the binaries somewhere in your `$PATH`, and copy the modules to the directory set in the `PERL5LIB` environment variable.

I might add an `install.pl` if someone contributes with one.

Good luck, and happy keyboard layout tweaking.
